# Entity-Resolution-Example
an example of using ASK entity resolution 

This skill will:
1. Show how entity resolution can be used to resolve a canonical value from a synonym provided by the user.
2. Show how entity resolution can be used to quickly determine if the slot provided by the user is explicitly included in your model as a value or synonym.

Paste the content of model.json into the code editor of the ASK skill builder beta, and apply changes.
After creating your Lambda function using the fact skill template, paste the content of index.js into the inline code editor window.

You won't be able to test this skill using the service simulator in the ASK console, so either use a device linked to your dev account, or echosim.io.

Launch the skill, and ask "what is a pal".
